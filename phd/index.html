            One of the most important parameters describing the quality of a microscopic image
            is its resolution. Many modifications to standard fluorescence methods have been
            introduced in order to improve the resolution of images. Consequently, among
            others an optical microscopy (super-resolution) technique called <b class="orange">
            Single Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM)</b> has been introduced.
            The term super-resolution may be applied to any optical microscopy technique that
            allows increasing the resolution beyond the theoretical Abbe’s limit. Conventional
            microscopy techniques (e.g. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy) are limited by the
            imposed 180-nanometre resolution limit, while super-resolution techniques
            circumvent this restriction. For SMLM positions of single fluorescent molecules
            are identified and registered in order to obtain high quality images (see
            Figure 1, Figure 2 and Video 1).

              experiment.</b>
              The investigated biological specimen is stained with a chosen fluorescent dye.
              There are many single molecules of the dye piled together and fluorescing
              simultaneously. By employing specific environment and illumination only a few
              fluorescent molecules become fluorescent at a time. Images of stochastically
              appearing fluorescing single molecules are registered until a sufficient number
              of single molecules is collected in order to reconstruct a super-resolution image
              of an investigated specimen. Positions of single molecules are localised with high
              precision, and later a super-resolution image is reconstructed.

            By using photoswitchable, photoconvertible, or photoactivable dyes/probes one
            can activate the fluorescence of only a few molecules at a time, making it
            possible to apply SMLM, and obtain images of cell structures with resolution
            greater than 180 nm. The current choice of fluorescent dyes/probes eligible for
            single molecule localisation microscopy is rather broad, and the research based on
            these fluorophores is constantly developing. Nevertheless, so far, the majority of
            the conducted research has been focused on cell structures that are easily accessible
            to the dyes/probes, like microtubules or actin filaments (e.g. by applying low molecular
            weight dyes (like e.g. Alexa Fluor 488) conjugated to antibodies). One very important
            field that seeks further investigation is research on DNA structure. DNA, due to its
            extremely dense packing in a cell nucleus, forms complicated structures. There are not
            many fluorescent dyes/probes eligible for super-resolution imaging of DNA. Even if the
            indirect forms of labelling are considered (e.g. fusions with proteins, immunolabelling)
            and the direct forms of labelling (e.g. using small DNA binding dyes), the choice of
            eligible fluorophores is still very limited. In my PhD thesis I have focused on
            investigation of photoconvertible dyes that are directly binding to DNA, i.e.
            <b class="orange">DAPI, Hoechst 33258/33342, and Vybrant® DyeCycle™ Violet</b>. Even though DAPI
            and Hoechst dyes have been known for many years now, their exploitation in super-resolution
            microscopy has not been described so far, as their blinking behaviour has not been reported.

              of VdcV (conc. 500 nM) are reversibly bleached and stochastically reappear in the detection
              channel of the SPDM microscope. Note that some of the molecules appear bright with much longer
              lifetime than the integration time of the camera.

            The key to the successful exploitation of the abovementioned dyes in super-resolution
            microscopy is the process of their <b class="orange">photoconversion, and generation of the
              green-emitting photoproducts</b>. DAPI and Hoechst dyes bind to DNA by means of minor
            groove binding, which is an undeniable advantage, as the dyes themselves do not
            significantly perturb the chromatin structure. Additionally, all of the proposed
            dyes enable direct and dense labelling of DNA. They are of low molecular weight and
            they penetrate into the chromatin structures much more easily than antibodies or big
            fluorescent proteins. In my thesis I have investigated photophysical properties of the
            above mentioned dyes and applied those dyes in single molecule localisation microscopy,
            to obtain high quality images of DNA structures (Figure 3).
