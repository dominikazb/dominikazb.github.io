            <p>
              Every fourth adult in the European Union requires rehabilitation. With the eldering
              society this number is constantly growing. The access to medical care is uneven
              for different countries. The main problem for the healthcare system is the insufficient
              number of medical specialists. Consequently, the waiting time for rehabilitation increases
              significantly. In Poland the average waiting time for rehabilitation services is 130 days!
              Therefore, remote healthcare is one of the fastest growing fields in medical healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mobile rehabilitation currently covers less than 0.6% of the telemedical market. Nevertheless, this
              segment is prognosed to be the fastest growing element of the telemedical market in the next 3-5 years. It
              provides the patients with safety of rehabilitation, constant remote control and the supervision of the
              medical specialist, as well as an increased motivation to exercise. It allows medical doctors and
              physiotherapists to supervise the patient at the distance, to monitor the progress of rehabilitation, and
              to supervise large number of patients simultaneously, as well as it allows for the reduction of the cost
              of work and optimisation of the time of work.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              mobiREH is a remote rehabilitation system allowing patients to exercise at the home settings, being at the
              same time under strict supervision of a medical specialist.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This project was created by the group of medical doctors, physiotherapists, programmers and engineers in
              2014. In 2015 we established a company named mReh (with capital investment of 260 000 PLN) for the purpose
              of performing mobiReh project. During this time, in collaboration with The University of Physical
              Education in Kraków, Jagiellonian University Medical College, and AGH University of Science and
              Technology, we have developed 3 versions of prototypes of the wearable sensors for the knee joint,
              programmed the software (www platform, mobile applications, editor for creating exercises) and we have
              tested the mobiReh system.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>mobiREH</h4>
            <p>
              mobiREH system consists of (1) wearable sensors for remote rehabilitation of the patient, (2) dedicated
              mobile application, and (3) web-based platform for medical specialists.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>1. WEARABLE SENSORS</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              Wearable sensors monitor the correctness of the performed exercises. Currently we dispose of sensors for
              rehabilitation of the knee joint. We have used the existing technologies and combined them with our own
              mathematical algorithms.

            <h4>2. MOBILE APP FOR THE PATIENT</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              The application for the Android operating system presents the patient with individualised sets of
              exercises, and thanks to combining it with wearable sensors it verifies the correctness of the performed
              exercises in real time. It allows for the monitoring by the physiotherapists and for direct contact.

            <h4>3. WEB PLATFORM</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              Web platform allows the physiotherapist to plan individualised sets of exercises. Additionally thanks to
              the full analysis of the collected medical data (from the wearable sensor), it allows for monitoring of
              the progress and the entire process of the rehabilitation of the patient. As both patient and
              physiotherapist have access to the platform, it is a tool for contact between the medical specialist and
              the patient.

            MobiReh increases the safety and availability of rehabilitation. Our system allows for complex care over
            the patient and increases patient’s motivation for performing exercises. The system assures a continuous
            care of the physiotherapists, even when the patient is at home. At the same time, the system provides the
            physiotherapist with complete medical data from the rehabilitation process and allows for a constant
            contact with the patient. We are offering a set of tools to support rehabilitation at the distance.
